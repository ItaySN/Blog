                <h1>Covid - 19 </h1>
                <div>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.{<br/>}

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.{<br/>}  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.{<br/>}

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.{<br/>} Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. {<br/>}

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</div>
